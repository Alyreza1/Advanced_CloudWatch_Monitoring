# Advanced_CloudWatch_Monitoring
Implement Advanced CloudWatch Monitoring for a Web Server

The objective of this project is to utilize CloudWatch Logs, a robust and scalable service, for centralizing logs generated across your systems, applications, and AWS services. Within this lab, you will learn to set up an EC2 instance, enabling it to transmit its Apache web server error logs directly to CloudWatch Logs. Through configuring the necessary agent and subsequently verifying the log streaming process in the CloudWatch Logs console, you'll gain hands-on experience in efficiently managing log data. By the conclusion of this lab, you'll have the expertise to install the CloudWatch Logs agent and adeptly configure it to seamlessly stream logs to the CloudWatch Logs service.
